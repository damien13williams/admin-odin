# **Admin-Odin**

## **Admin Project**
This project is part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS unit in the Odin Project under the "Grid" chapter. It is a simple admin dashboard that allows users to see their projects, hobbies, and ideas for the future. I take it as a way to look at everything I have done and hopefully after I complete the Odin project it will be improved and full of eveyrthing I have done all in one "admin page" that is really like a portfolio of myself to show in the future.
